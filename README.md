## **Project Overview:**
This Power BI dashboard provides an end-to-end analysis of emergency room visits across key dimensions such as appointment type, demographics, referrals, and patient satisfaction. Designed to support healthcare administrators and analysts, it aims to uncover patterns in patient flow and service efficiency, and guide data-driven improvements in operational decision-making.

## **The project showcases:**

Multi-layered visual analysis across time, department, and demographics

Key performance indicators like satisfaction score and wait times

Dynamic segmentation (e.g., walk-in vs. referred, administrative vs. non-administrative)

Real-world healthcare application of DAX, Power Query, and best practices in visual storytelling

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Insights**
**Total Visits:** 4,584 patients analyzed, split nearly evenly between administrative (50.74%) and non-administrative (49.26%) appointments

**Satisfaction Scores:** Average score is 5.50, with ~25.5% of services remaining unratedâ€”suggesting potential gaps in feedback collection

**Referral Dynamics:** Referred patients (58.33%) outnumber walk-ins (41.67%), pointing to structured intake patterns

**Wait Time Monitoring:** Average wait time sits at 34.98 minutes, a key metric for service efficiency

**Demographic Distribution:**

**Gender:** Balanced mix of male (49.1%) and female (50.6%)

**Age Groups:** Adults dominate visits, followed by middle childhood and teenagers

**Race-based Satisfaction:** Notable satisfaction variations captured via a race-age heatmap

**Year-over-Year Trends:** Visits rose from 2,161 in 2019 to 2,423 in 2020â€”an increase of ~12%

**Department Referrals:** General Practice accounts for the majority (916), followed by Orthopedics (526) and Cardiology (131)

**Monthly Fluctuations:** June shows a noticeable peak in visits (492), while other months remain steady

## ðŸ”§ **Tools & Techniques**
**Power BI:** DAX for KPI calculations, slicers for interactivity, and card visuals for impact

**Power Query:** Data transformation and cleaning

**Design Principles:** Intuitive layout, consistent color themes, and layered visual hierarchy
